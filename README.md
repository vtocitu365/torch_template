# PyTorch Experiments Repository

This Git repository contains a single Jupyter notebook that encompasses a series of experiments using PyTorch for various tasks. The notebook covers the following experiments:

## Experiment Overview

### 1. **Image Classification with PyTorch:**
   - Utilizes PyTorch for image classification. The experiment involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset to demonstrate image classification capabilities.

### 2. **Variational Autoencoder Training:**
   - Implements and trains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch. The notebook showcases the process of generating new data points using the learned latent space.

### 3. **Neural Transfer: Kanagawa to Falcon 9 Image:**
   - Demonstrates Neural Transfer techniques using PyTorch. The experiment focuses on transferring style features from the famous Kanagawa wave image to a Falcon 9 launch image, showcasing artistic style transfer capabilities.

### 4. **ANN Regressor on Sonar Dataset:**
   - Trains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regressor on the Sonar dataset. The notebook illustrates how PyTorch can be employed for regression tasks.
